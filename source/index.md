This documentation is for Version 1 of the Capitol Words API. Version 1 is currently the only version, and is actively maintained.

## Getting started

Listed below are the public methods currently supported by the Capitol
Words API. All requests must be signed with a valid Sunlight labs API
key. You can register for one here:
<http://services.sunlightlabs.com/accounts/register>

### Discussion & Bugs

Sunlight API discussion takes place at the
[sunlightlabs-api-discuss google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunlightlabs-api-discuss).
You can ask questions there, as well as alert the maintainers of bugs.
If you have specific issues with the Capitol Words API, you can open a
ticket directly at
[github](http://github.com/sunlightlabs/Capitol-Words/issues).

### Root URI

All endpoints below are relative to the API root:

    http://capitolwords.org/api/1
